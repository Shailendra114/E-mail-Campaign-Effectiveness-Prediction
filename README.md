# Introduction 
Sending email is one of the alternatives used by Companies to tell and promote certain event sale to users. With the ability to be able to predict whether user is reading or not reading the email, enable Companies to evaluate their crew works during campaign period until event launch. This is because, when user is open the email, the possibility of that user know there is an event or promo will be highly increased and also increasing the possibility of that user do transaction during event period. Therefore, with the making of this model, hopefully Companies be able to build a strategy for future marketing.
